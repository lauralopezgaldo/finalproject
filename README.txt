# Fundamental of Computer Science - Final project

This repository corresponds to my final proyect, focused on Perceptual Bistability exercises - based on 'A Spiking Neuron Model for Binocular Rivalry' (Laing and Chow, 2002) and 'Noise-Induced Alternations in an Attractor Network Model of
Perceptual Bistability' (Moreno-Bote et al., 2007)

Perceptual Bistability refers to the switching phenomenon that occurs when we are exposed to two different stimulus. As we cannot perceive them at the same time, our brain changes from one to the other.

Throughout this exercises, the duration of each stimulus, its dominance and dependance on specific characteristics is studied.
